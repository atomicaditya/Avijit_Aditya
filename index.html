    Hello Camper!

    For now, the test suite only works in Chrome!
    Please read the README below in the JS Editor before beginning.
    Feel free to delete this message once you have read it.
    Good luck and Happy Coding!

          <h2>An electronic calculator</h2>
          <p> It is a device used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.</p>
          </header>

      <section class="main-section" id="input">
        <header>
          <h2>Input</h2>
          <p> Electronic calculators contain a keyboard with buttons for digits and arithmetical operations; some even contain "00" and "000" buttons to make larger or smaller numbers easier to enter. Most basic calculators assign only one digit or operation on each button; however, in more specific calculators, a button can perform multi-function working with key combinations.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="display_output">
        <header>
          <h2>Display output</h2>
          <p> Calculators usually have liquid-crystal displays (LCD) as output in place of historical light-emitting diode (LED) displays and vacuum fluorescent displays (VFD); details are provided in the section Technical improvements.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="memory">
        <header>
          <h2>Memory</h2>
          <p> Calculators also have the ability to store numbers into computer memory. Basic calculators usually store only one number at a time; more specific types are able to store many numbers represented in variables. The variables can also be used for constructing formulas. Some models have the ability to extend memory capacity to store more numbers; the extended memory address is termed an array index.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="power_source">

        <header>
          <h2>Power source</h2>
          <p> Power sources of calculators are: batteries, solar cells or mains electricity (for old models), turning on with a switch or button. Some models even have no turn-off button but they provide some way to put off (for example, leaving no operation for a moment, covering solar cell exposure, or closing their lid). Crank-powered calculators were also common in the early computer era.</p>
